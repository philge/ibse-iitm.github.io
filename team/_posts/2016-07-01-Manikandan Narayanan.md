Dr. Manikandan Narayanan is an Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He is also a core faculty at the Initiative for Biological Systems Engineering. His research areas include bioinformatics, computational network biology, and systems biology/genomics in health and disease.

Manikandan is interested in network models of complex cellular behaviors, especially ones that bear relevance to local diseases. Central to his research is the development and application of computational methods involving probabilistic models or graph-theoretic algorithms, which have shown promise in his current research in revealing how networks of interacting genes rewire during neurodegenerative disease or immune states. His ongoing and future research at the interface of computer science and biology would tackle new combinatorial/inference problems that arise when analyzing genomic data from these emerging areas: multi-tissue behaviors (for which he has support from the Wellcome-Trust/DBT Intermediate Fellowship grant award), disease-disease interactions (for which he hopes to collaborate with clinical centers in Chennai or other local areas) and single-cell behaviors.

Prior to joining IIT, Manikandan was a Staff Scientist in the Systems Genomics and Bioinformatics Unit at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science (with an emphasis in computational and genomic biology) from the University of California at Berkeley, and has also held a Sr. Research Scientist position at Merck Research Labs in Seattle and Boston.
