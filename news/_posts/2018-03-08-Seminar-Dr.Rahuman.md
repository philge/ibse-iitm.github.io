IBSE is very pleased to introduce you all to our guest speaker Dr. Rahuman Sheriff. The title of his presentation will be: "Dynamics of cellular signalling networks: lessons from quantitative imaging"

Dr. Rahuman Sheriff is a Project Leader at European Bioinformatics Institute, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL-EBI). His interest pertains to Systems Biology, Mathematical modelling of Biological processes, BioModels tools and resource development, curation, Translational quantitative systems toxicology data analysis and data management platform development. In his joint postdoctoral position between, EMBL-EBI and MRC-LMS, Imperial College London, UK, he developed image processing tools and theoretical approaches to reconstruct the signalling networks from single cell imaging data of human embryonic stem cells differentiation. During his PhD at Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology (MPI), Germany, he established a multi-colour live cell imaging system and developed novel statistical approaches and advanced software to analyze multidimensional imaging data to capture complex regulations observed in the dynamics of cell-matrix adhesion sites.  He had worked in collaboration with MPI and Department of Statistics, University of Dortmund, to develop a novel Bayesian approach for resolving a mixture of signalling networks. Furthermore, he had also worked on an interdisciplinary research collaboration between TIFR Centre for Applied Mathematics and National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS). Through IASc fellowship he had also visited Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB). With hands-on experience in both wet and dry lab work, he custom developed novel computational tools to facilitate quantitative analysis of experimental data and collaboration between theoretical and experimental groups and institutions.
