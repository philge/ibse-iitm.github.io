miR-34 family consists of three microRNAs, namely miR-34a , miR-34b and miR-34c. The loss of expression of miR-34 has been linked to resistance against apoptosis and is frequently found to have aberrant expression profiles in various tumors. We use the TCGA RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data on cervical cancer to try and predict the more prominent targets of these miRs in the specific tumor site. We are also exploring for any links to the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition(EMT) pathway which contributes to metastasis in cervical cancer and the differences in microRNA regulation between cancers originating from different tissues by using the TCGA data on uterine, ovarian, colorectal and oral cancers since they are epithelial in origin just like cervical cancer.
