# About

The Initiative for Biological Systems Engineering (IBSE) at IIT Madras is an interdisciplinary group dedicated to pioneering innovative approaches and algorithms that integrate multi-dimensional data across scales, to understand, predict and manipulate complex biological systems. In so doing, we aim not only to advance fundamental understanding of cells and their interactions as populations forming complex organs but also to empower personalised medicine.

# Join Us!

We encourage faculty to initiate collaborations with IBSE faculty, as well as interested graduate and 
undergraduate students to reach out to the IBSE faculty / students, to initiate projects. 

### IBSE Interdisciplinary MS/PhD Programme

In December 2017, we plan to admit interdisciplinary MS/PhD students to the IBSE programme.

### IIT Madras Regular MS/PhD Programme

IIT Madras accepts MS/PhD applications all year round now, and you can choose to work with IBSE faculty, based on your interests.

### Dual Degree / Undergraduate Projects

IBSE already hosts several undergraduate / dual degree projects. Feel free to reach out to any of the IBSE faculty for possible projects.
